🚀 AI-ML Journey

A 60-day learning sprint to become an AI/ML Engineer

Welcome to my AI-ML Journey, where I document everything I learn, practice, and build over the next 60 days.
This repository is my public record of progress as I deepen my skills in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, and MLOps through consistent, hands-on work.

📅 Why This Journey?

For a long time, I wanted to move from “knowing the basics” to actually building real ML systems, understanding algorithms deeply, and deploying end-to-end models.
This 60-day challenge is my commitment to:

Strengthen core ML foundations

Gain practical experience with real datasets

Build and evaluate ML models

Explore NLP, LLMs, and LangChain

Understand deployment and MLOps

Grow as a developer through consistency and discipline

📘 What You’ll Find in This Repository

This repo contains all my daily learnings and experiments:

🔹 Daily Practice Files

Python scripts for Regression, Classification, EDA, NLP, and model evaluation.

🔹 Mini-Projects

Small but meaningful ML projects testing real-world scenarios.

🔹 Notes & Concepts

Clear explanations of ML fundamentals, metrics, workflows, and algorithms.

🔹 Hands-on Scikit-learn Implementations

End-to-end ML pipelines (train-test split → training → prediction → evaluation).

🔹 Upcoming Content

Deep Learning (ANNs, CNNs, RNNs)

NLP basics and text-processing

Building LLM applications

MLOps and model deployment

🧠 Goals for the 60 Days

Build a solid ML foundation

Complete daily hands-on coding

Understand model evaluation deeply

Learn how real-world ML pipelines work

Implement both traditional ML & modern AI workflows

Deploy at least 1 end-to-end ML project

Document everything publicly for accountability
